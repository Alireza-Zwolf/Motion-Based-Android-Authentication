# Motion-based Authentication

## Description
In this project , we developed an authentication system based on cell phones's movement.
The user can set a pattern for authentication and the sytems will save the pattern . Then , each time a user wants to access the mobile phone , he has to execute the pattern exactly.
The sytstem save the movement done by user , calculate the distance and rotation degree , determine the movement direction  and then compare the movement with saved pattern . ( The movement should be identical with pattern both in length for drifts and degree for rotation. )

The system is powered by useful UI which makes it easy to use . Each time a user tries to access the mobile phone , system  itself clear the history and analyze the new movement.
